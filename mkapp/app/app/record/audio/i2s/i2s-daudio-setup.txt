1. make kernel_menuconfig to enable daudio module
   Device Drivers > Sound card support > Advanced Linux Sound Architecture > ALSA for SoC audio support > Allwinner SoC Audio Support 

   check
   Allwinner Digital Audio Support

   check the following for debug
   AIO debugfs driver for mpp
   Allwinner Audio Debug Support

2. cofnigure daudio in sys_config.fex

[snddaudo0]
snddaudio0_used = 1

[daudio0]
daudio0_used		= 1
daudio_master		= 1
audio_format		= 1
signal_inversion	= 1
slot_width_select 	= 32
pcm_lrck_period		= 32
word_select_size	= 16
msb_lsb_first		= 0
sign_extend 		= 0
frametype 			= 0
mclk_div			= 0
tdm_config			= 1
tx_data_mode 		= 0
rx_data_mode 		= 0

3. enbable daudio0 & daudio2 in linux dts
   modify lichee/linux-4.9/arch/arm/boot/dts/sun8iw16p1.dtsi
   change daudio0 & daudio2 status to "okay"

4. must do: set i2s0 format to i2s(not pcm) menuually
   write register 0x05090000 to 0x00060010:
   aww 0x05090000 0x00060010

   this should be done by driver, because we have conigured in dts and sys_config.fex both, but it didn't!!
